# üìö Automated Book Publication Workflow (Backend API)

This project is a complete, multi-agent backend system designed to automate the initial stages of book publication. It features a robust API to scrape content from a web URL, leverage AI agents for rewriting and reviewing, and support a full human-in-the-loop (HITL) workflow with versioning, semantic search, and voice command capabilities.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Agent AI Pipeline**  
  Sequentially uses an AI Writer and an AI Reviewer to process content, ensuring higher quality output.

- **Semantic Search**  
  Leverages a vector database (ChromaDB) to allow for searching by meaning and concept, not just keywords.

- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**  
  Provides API endpoints for human editors to review, edit, and approve content, with all versions tracked.

- **RLHF Data Pipeline**  
  Automatically generates a preference dataset from human edits, ready to be used for fine-tuning AI models.

- **Voice-to-Text Commands**  
  Includes an endpoint that uses OpenAI's Whisper model to transcribe voice commands for hands-free searching.

## üì° API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint              | Description                                                                 |
|--------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/process-chapter/`   | Triggers the full, end-to-end automated workflow from scraping to AI review. |
| GET    | `/search/`            | Performs a semantic search across all document versions using a text query. |
| POST   | `/search/voice`       | Performs a semantic search by uploading a recorded audio file.              |
| POST   | `/edit-chapter/`      | Allows a human to submit a final, edited version of a chapter.              |
| GET    | `/dataset/preference` | Generates a preference dataset from human edits for RLHF training.          |
